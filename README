TwoBitChunker takes an image (preferably black & white) and finds individual chunks inside the image. It does this by scanning for rows and columns of white/clear data and using that information to generate simple bounding boxes. These sub-images are extracted, saved as PNGs and C source with one bit per pixel.

The input should be a GIF, PNG, or JPEG image. Pixels with an average RGB value over 127 will be considered black, all others white. Transparency will be ignored.

Outputs will be sequentially numbered PNGs and C source (i.e. 1.png and 1.c, 2.png and 2.c, etc). Inside the C files will be four variables: imageXWidth, imageXHeight, imageXBytes, and imageXData. Width and height will be bytes, data is a single-dimensional array of bytes containing the pixel data, padded to byte boundaries with 0s, in row order.
